## Description 
This application is a Fitness Tracker designed to record and save workouts. The user is able to log as many different exercises as they'd like each day. They will be asked to enter the exercise name, type, and duration. Optionally, they can enter the weight, sets, and reps for resistance workouts or the distance traveled for cardio workouts. The user can also view all previous workouts and track their progress through the dashboard.
